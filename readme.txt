This is a matlabscript that uses Newton-Rhapson method to find the intersection points for three surfaces in space. The surface value are given in descreete points, so there is need for interpolation. Chosen here are three-linear shape functions for a cube. See file newtonR for more details on the algorithm. The file examples.m contains four examples that uses the newtonR algorithm. The fourth example there is from rock physics.
